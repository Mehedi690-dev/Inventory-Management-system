- Categories
- Transactions/Orders
- Users

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7 or higher**
2. **MySQL Server** installed and running
3. **MySQL Connector for Python**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash

cd Inventory-Management-System
```

### Step 2: Install Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

### Step 3: Set Up MySQL Database

1. Start your MySQL server
2. Create a new database for the inventory system:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
```

3. Create the necessary tables (schema provided in the application or documentation)

### Step 4: Configure Database Connection

Edit the database connection settings in the Python script:

```python
# Example configuration
db_config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'database': 'inventory_db'
}
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
python "inventory management system.py"
```
